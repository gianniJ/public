This presentation is about two related topics: the current state of affairs 
of the BFQ (Budget Fair Queueing) I/O scheduler, and its relation with the 
ongoing work in the Linux kernel for keeping pace with the growing speed of 
modern, solid-state devices. As for BFQ, it seems to be on the right track to 
be merged into mainline, and replace the current default I/O scheduler. In this 
presentation we will also see BFQ in action with an SSD, and briefly discuss 
some of the inner workings of BFQ related to high-speed devices. Finally, as 
for the ongoing kernel work for achieving high I/O rates, we will highlight 
and question possible misconceptions about the ability of the current multi-queue 
I/O infrastructure to make I/O-related latencies negligible for applications.

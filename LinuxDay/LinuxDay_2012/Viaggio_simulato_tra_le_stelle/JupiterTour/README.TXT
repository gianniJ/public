* JupiterTour.cel - Version 2.01 - For use with Celestia 1.3.2 Pre1 or later.       *
*                   Revised on 5 Dec 04 to make for a better (at least to me) Tour. *
*                                                                                   *
* This script requires that you have the jupmoons2.ssc AND the Gipul.ssc files      *
* located in your Program Files\Celestia\extras directory. These files have been    *
* included in this package for your convenience.                                    *
*                                                                                   *
* Simply unzip the JupiterTour.cel file to your main Celestia directory, and the    *
* jupmoons2.ssc and Gipul.ssc files to your Celestia\extras directory.              *
*                                                                                   *
* NOTE: If you currently have the jupmoons.ssc file in your Celestia\extras         *
*       directory, please DELETE this file from your system, and REPLACE it with    *
*       the jupmoons2.ssc file. This will be necessary in order to place locations  *
*       correctly using Celestia V1.3.2 Pre1 or later.                              *
*                                                                                   *
* NOTE: If you don't wish to see *all* Jupiter moon locations displayed while       *
*       running this script, then select "Render" from Celestia's menu taskbar      *
*       and select "Locations" and uncheck the "Label Features" box. Right now,     *
*       there's no way to do this from within a script. If you like, you can also   *
*       press SHIFT and "&" to do the same thing.                                   *
*                                                                                   *
*       This script was written for use with Celestia 1.3.2 Pre1 and later          *
*       versions.                                                                   *
*                                                                                   *
* Further information: This is the minimal JupiterTour Package. If you would also   *
